											  <strong> Can the terms of service change?<br>
											  </strong> Yes, More4less Plans has the right to change any of the terms of service, including rates, without notice. Changes become effective thirty days after being
posted at more4lessplans.ca. By purchasing service after a change is posted, including by continuing to top up your account, you accept the current
terms of service. You can cancel service at any time, without penalty or cancellation fees.    <br><br>              
												
												
				<strong> Where will I have coverage?<br>
				</strong> Service covers almost all of the populated areas in Canada, USA and Mexico. Coverage areas, and the connectivity
in these areas, will depend on the availability of network facilities. These are subject to change from time to time,
without notice.<br><br>
												
												
												
												
												
	<strong> Can I use any device with this service?<br>
	</strong> Although networks are able to support a wide range of devices, not all devices will work on our networks. Your wireless device and software
must meet our standards to access our service and operate properly with our service. Such standards may change from time to time at our sole
discretion and you are responsible for updating your device and software as necessary to meet these standards. The "Bottomless Data Plan" is a prepaid service and is non-refundable. Upon purchase you agree to prepay for 30 days of service. The service is meant for mobile phones, and can only be guaranteed to work with such. There are no guarantees of the service working with any mobile hotspot or hub. We do not recommend this plan for hubs and routers. That being said, we allow you as the customer to purchase with the intentions to use it with a mobile hub or router. Some routers and hubs can take full advantage of the unlimited data plan but we cannot offer any guarantees or refunds. The processing fee is non-refundable. We are not responsible for any errors you make attempting to follow the instructions. Please only submit your information once. It is your responsibility to provide accurate information, any errors can cause delays for your plan to be set up, loss of a preferred number, or account cancellation. If the setup fees are not paid, your account is subject to cancellation, thus losing your phone number. Any late payment is subject to a $30 late payment fee.  Your submitted information remains private. No information is kept, other than your contact information you provided. You authorize us to provide information about and to make changes to your account, including adding new service, upon the direction of any person able to provide information we deem sufficient to identify you. You consent to the use by us or our authorized agents of regular mail, predictive or autodialing equipment, email, text messaging, facsimile or other reasonable means to contact you to advise you about our services or other matters we believe may be of interest to you. In any event, we reserve the right to contact you by any means regarding customer service-related notifications, or other such information.Please ensure your device is unlocked or eligible to use with the proper network. Please sort out any fees that may be charged to you if you are ending a contract prematurely with another carrier. The advertised price excludes tax and additional add ons. The advertised price is our standard recommended price. We are not responsible for any additional costs due to a more costly plan option being selected. This plan costs $69 a month plus tax. The processing fee does not include your first month of service. You are not be able to transfer your existing number in to use with our plan. If you need to keep your existing phone number this is achievable using a dual SIM device and a secondary line. A similar experience can be achieved by simply using a VOIP app to receive calls and texts on your existing number. We may also remotely update or
change the software and settings on your device at any time without notice to ensure that it continues to operate properly on our service. A device that has
been reported lost or stolen cannot be used with the service.     <br><br>
