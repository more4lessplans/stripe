											  <h2><strong>Service Terms between
You and More4Less</strong></h2>
												
												
												
												
												
											
											  <p> These Service Terms describe the services provided to you, as well as billing and warranty information, your
											    privacy rights and service cancellation. As part of our commitment to putting customers first, we want to make sure that we are clear and transparent in
											    helping you fully understand what More4Less provides. By using our services, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined below.<br>
  <br>
  <strong> As you read through these Service Terms, please note that:<br>
  </strong> • “I”, “me”, “your” and “you” refers to the More4Less customer who is responsible for paying for the service;<br>
											    • “We”, “us” and “our” refers to the division of More4Less Group.;<br>
											    • “Device” means any type of wireless telecommunications device that you use to access the&nbsp; network including mobile phones, tablets, Internet keys and more.<br>
											    • “Month” means the thirty day period from the purchase of a rate plan to the expiry of service on that rate plan, and does not vary with the length of
											    calendar months.<br>
											    • “Service” means the action provided of keeping your account active and in working condition. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong> How does this service work?<br>
  </strong> • With prepaid service, you purchase service in advance..<br>
											    • Prepaid service is valid for as long as you have a rate plan active on the account. Rate plans expire every thirty days unless they are renewed.<br>
											    • Current rates and conditions are available at more4lessplans.ca<br>
											    • Prepaid service purchases are non-refundable. <br>
											    • If the phone user does not have authority, they can contact an authorized user on the account for permission or they can have the authorized
											    user add more data or minutes to that phone, which can be done online.<br>
												 • The More4Less Group is not a telecom provider. You agree upon activation to pay the set fees to the More4Less Group and thereby allow them access to manage, change and suspend your service. The More4Less Group is a service manager, and is only responsible for managing your plan for you.
												  <br></p>
											  <p>
												  
												
												  
											    <br>
											    <strong> Can the terms of service change?<br>
										        </strong> Yes, More4less Plans has the right to change any of the terms of service, including rates, without notice. Changes become effective thirty days after being
											    posted at more4lessplans.ca. By purchasing service after a change is posted, including by continuing to top up your account, you accept the current
											    terms of service. You can cancel service at any time, without penalty or cancellation fees. <br>
  <br>
  <strong> Where will I have coverage?<br>
  </strong> The network covers almost all of the populated areas in Canada, USA and Mexico. Coverage areas, and the connectivity
											    in these areas, will depend on the availability of network facilities. These are subject to change from time to time,
											    without notice.<br>
  <br>
  <strong> Can I use any device with this service?<br>
  </strong> Although networks are able to support a wide range of devices, not all devices will work on our networks. Your wireless device and software
											    must meet our standards to access our service and operate properly with our service. Such standards may change from time to time at our sole
											    discretion and you are responsible for updating your device and software as necessary to meet these standards. The "Bottomless Data Plan" is a prepaid service and is non-refundable. Upon purchase you agree to prepay for 30 days of service. The service is meant for mobile phones, and can only be guaranteed to work with such. There are no guarantees of the service working with any mobile hotspot or hub. We do not recommend this plan for hubs and routers. That being said, we allow you as the customer to purchase with the intentions to use it with a mobile hub or router. Some routers and hubs can take full advantage of the unlimited data plan but we cannot offer any guarantees or refunds. The processing fee is non-refundable. We are not responsible for any errors you make attempting to follow the instructions. Please only submit your information once. It is your responsibility to provide accurate information, any errors can cause delays for your plan to be set up, loss of a preferred number, or account cancellation. 
											    
											    
											    
											    Your submitted information remains private. No information is kept, other than your contact information you provided. You authorize us to provide information about and to make changes to your account, including adding new service, upon the direction of any person able to provide information we deem sufficient to identify you. You consent to the use by us or our authorized agents of regular mail, predictive or autodialing equipment, email, text messaging, facsimile or other reasonable means to contact you to advise you about our services or other matters we believe may be of interest to you. In any event, we reserve the right to contact you by any means regarding customer service-related notifications, or other such information.Please ensure your device is unlocked or eligible to use with the proper network. Please sort out any fees that may be charged to you if you are ending a contract prematurely with another carrier. The advertised price excludes tax and additional add ons. The advertised price is our standard recommended price. We are not responsible for any additional costs due to a more costly plan option being selected. The processing fee does not include your first month of service. You are not be able to transfer your existing number in to use with our plan. If you need to keep your existing phone number this is achievable using a dual SIM device and a secondary line. A similar experience can be achieved by simply using a VOIP app to receive calls and texts on your existing number. 
											    
											    We may also remotely update or
											    change the software and settings on your device at any time without notice to ensure that it continues to operate properly on our service. A device that has
											    been reported lost or stolen cannot be used with the service. <br>
  <br>

  </strong> We may restrict, suspend, block, disconnect or cancel any or all of your
											    Services, Equipment, accounts or identifiers in any way, including 9-1-1

											    cancelled for any reason
											    
											    If we restrict, suspend, block, disconnect or cancel your Services or
											    accounts:
											    i. you must pay any amounts owing;
											    ii. we may also restrict, suspend, block, disconnect or cancel,

											    (including accounts that may be in good standing);

											    If we do not receive payment of an amount due on your account by the
											    specified required payment date, it will be subject to a late payment
											    charge of 30 per month. This late payment charge will accrue on a
											    daily basis and will be calculated and compounded monthly on the
											    outstanding amount (42.58% per year) from the date of the first bill on
											    which it appears until the date we receive that amount in full. You agree
											    that we can charge any unpaid and outstanding amount, including any
											    late payment charges, on any pre-authorized payment method on your
											    account (e.g., a credit card or bank account withdrawal). <br>
  <br>
  <strong> What limitations apply to any claim made against More4Less?<br>
  </strong> More4Less Group is not responsible for:
											    1. Libel, slander, defamation or the infringement of copyright arising from material or messages transmitted from your property or premises or recorded
											    by your equipment or More4Less’s equipment;
											    2. Damages arising out of your act, default, neglect or omission in the use or operation of equipment provided by More4Less;
											    3. Damages arising out of the transmission of material or messages over More4Less networks on your behalf, which is in any way unlawful; or
											    4. Any act, omission or negligence of other companies or telecommunications systems in relation to the provision of the service to you, when the facilities
											    of such other companies or telecommunications systems are used to establish connections to or from facilities and equipment controlled by you.

											    profits, loss of earnings, loss of business opportunities, loss of data, economic loss or other similar loss, or punitive damages) arising out of or in
											    connection with the use or failure of the service, whether caused by negligence or otherwise, and whether claimed in contract, tort or otherwise.
											    These limitations of liability extend to the benefit of third party providers of audio or audiovisual programming services delivered to your device through the
											    service. In the case of the provision of emergency services on a mandatory basis, our liability to you, except in cases where negligence on the part of More4Less results in physical injury, death or damage to your property or premises, is limited to the greater of twenty dollars and three times the amount you
											    would otherwise be entitled to receive as a refund for the provision of defective service under your Agreement.
											    None of the limitations of liability stated above apply in cases of deliberate fault, gross negligence or anti-competitive conduct on the part of More4Less
											    or in cases of breach of contract where the breach results from our gross negligence. </p>
