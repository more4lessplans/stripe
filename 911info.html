											  <h2><strong>911 Information</strong></h2>
												
												
												
												
												
											
											  <p> 

The More4Less Plans Group & phone service uses the Internet to connect your calls. Although it acts the same as traditional telephone service, there are important differences with regards to 911 emergency calls.<br>
If you dial 911, your call will NOT be routed to the nearest emergency response center. Instead you will be routed to a specialized 911 call center that handles VoIP emergency calls. This call center is different from the regular emergency response center that would normally answer your 911 call in that you will be required to provide your name, phone number and address to the call center operator.<br>
The call center operator will first confirm your location and then transfer your 911 call to the nearest emergency response center in your area. You should be prepared to confirm your address and call-back number with the operator. Do NOT hang up unless told directly to do so and if disconnected dial 911 again.<br><br>
VoIP 911 ACCESS LIMITATIONS<br><br>
The More4Less Plans Group recommends that you always keep a cellular phone handy to ensure your access to emergency services. VoIP 911 Service will NOT be available if your Internet connection is down or your service is not available, e.g. in the case of a power failure or if your account has been suspended as a result of billing issues. 911 service will also not be available when calling from outside Canada or the USA.<br>
IF YOU MOVE or change the address from which you use your More4Less Plans service you MUST advise More4Less Plans immediately to ensure that your address information is kept current at all times. You can update your address online in your control panel. You can send an email to contact@more4lessplans.ca or call us at 647-559-1666.<br>
Make sure that you and all other potential users of the service understand and are aware of the VoIP 911 access limitations.
During a power outage or Internet outage your 911 Service will not be available. The More4Less Plans Group recommends that you keep a cellular phone handy for such circumstances.<br>
Keep your location information current. If the information is not correct and you are not able to speak during a 911 call, the emergency operator will assume that you are at the last registered address. Do not risk sending police or ambulance services to the wrong location.
Be prepared to confirm your location and call-back number with the operator who answers the 911 call since the operator may not have this information. Do NOT hang up until told to do so, and call back if you get disconnected.<br>
You agree that we may interrupt your phone service & 911 service temporarily, at any time, without notice, to perform system maintenance and repairs, for non-payment of your account, or for any other reasonable cause. You understand that loss of power, Internet related issues or acts of god will also prevent all broadband phone service, including 911 service.<br><br><br>
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MORE4LESSPLANS, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND UNDERLYING CARRIERS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, DEATH OR DAMAGE TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, OR RELATING TO THE 911 SERVICE AND YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS MOR4LESSPLANS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND UNDERLYING CARRIERS) FOR ANY LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES AND EXPENSES, (INCLUDING REASONABLE LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES) WHICH YOU MAY SUFFER OR INCUR, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR FAILURE TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO 911 SERVICE.
